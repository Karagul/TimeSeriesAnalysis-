# Predicting Sunspot Number by SARIMA Model

The dark spots visible on the surface of the sun due to the variation of the temperature caused by the concentration of the solar magnetic flux is called the sunspot. The dataset of a monthly sunspot from 1998 to 2016 prepared by Australian Bureau of Metrology (ABM) is analyzed using time series approach. Some seasonal effect and autocorrelation are noticed in the time series. The SARIMA(0,1,2)x(0,1,1)_4 model best explained this time series with all the parameter significant. The predicted trend of the series shows lesser variation in the series resembling the variation experienced between 2007 and 2011. Diagnostic check on the residuals is not as convincing which is an obvious limitation of the study.
