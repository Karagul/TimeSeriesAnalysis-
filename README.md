# Predicting Sunspot Number by SARIMA Model

## Background 

Importance of finding the analysis of sunspot numbers series is explained by data provider ABM as 
**“Although the prediction of solar cycles is difficult, it has practical applications. For example, in planning High Frequency (HF) communication links it is important to estimate what frequencies will be supported by the ionosphere well into the future. Predictions of sunspot number are also very important in planning space-related activities particularly for low Earth orbiting spacecraft.”**

This report analyzes the sunspot data by using the Time Series Analysis and accurately predict the sunspot number for the next 10 years and presents outcomes in comprehensive analysis report including descriptive analysis, proper visualization, model specification, model fitting and selection, and diagnostic checking. 

## Abstract 
The dark spots visible on the surface of the sun due to the variation of the temperature caused by the concentration of the solar magnetic flux is called the sunspot. The dataset of a monthly sunspot from 1998 to 2016 prepared by Australian Bureau of Metrology (ABM) is analyzed using time series approach. Some seasonal effect and autocorrelation are noticed in the time series. The SARIMA(0,1,2)x(0,1,1)_4 model best explained this time series with all the parameter significant. The predicted trend of the series shows lesser variation in the series resembling the variation experienced between 2007 and 2011. Diagnostic check on the residuals is not as convincing which is an obvious limitation of the study.
